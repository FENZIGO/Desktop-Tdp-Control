This applet allows you to manage the TDP (Thermal Design Power) settings of your Steam Deck directly from the desktop mode. Created for my own use, but it may be useful to someone.

## Installation

1. Download "SteamDeck TDP.plasmoid" from releases.
2. Run "kpackagetool5 -i SteamDeck\ TDP.plasmoid" from your Download directory.
3. PPM>Add Widgets... Add "SteamDeck TDP" widget.
4. By entering PPM>Enter Edit Mode, you can place the widget anywhere you want.
